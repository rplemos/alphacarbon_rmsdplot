# alphacarbon_rmsdplot
R Script to plot the RMSD of alpha-carbons between two protein structures


This script is made to read .csv files (four examples included as testing files) containing information about the RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) between the Alpha Carbons of two aligned protein structures. The mean and standard deviation of the values was also calculated to help identify potential disordered regions.
The RMSD was calculated using the software ChimeraX v1.2 (Pettersen et al., Protein Science, 2021).
